EATS Express

Description:

    EATS Express is a food delivery app similar to the likes of Uber Eats or Door Dash 
with a few twists. On EATS Express, users are able to browse the menu of food items
and order them to their door. Users will also have the ability to like a particular
food item which will provide further insight into what food items are popular.
Additionally, under each food item is an estimated delivery time as well as a button
that displays the price of the food item and allows the user to add that specific food item
to their cart.  
    The user also has the ability to request food that is not curretly on the menu by submitting
the name and image of a food item through a form. Once the user makes a food request, their requested
food item will appear on the menu with an estimated delivery time and price.
